# Hermes Studio

**Hermes Agent, right inside VS Code.**

Ask Hermes to fix a bug, explain some code or build a feature, and watch it work next to
your files. You keep everything that makes Hermes yours: the skills it learns, its
memory, and your ChatGPT, Codex or Claude subscription.

## Before you start

> **Hermes Studio needs Hermes Agent on your computer.** Hermes Studio is the window;
> Hermes is the brain. Hermes Agent is free and open source.

1. **Install Hermes Agent** for Windows, macOS or Linux:
   [hermes-agent.nousresearch.com](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs).
2. **Connect a model.** Open a terminal, run `hermes model` once and sign in with the
   provider you want to use (for example your ChatGPT, Codex or Claude subscription).
3. You need **VS Code 1.106 or later**.

That's it. Hermes Studio finds Hermes by itself.

## Get started

1. Install Hermes Studio from the
   [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jefuriiij.hermes-studio),
   or search for **Hermes Studio** in VS Code's Extensions view.
2. Open a project folder in VS Code.
3. Click the **Hermes icon** at the top right of any open file, or open the Command
   Palette (**Ctrl+Shift+P**) and run **Hermes Studio: Open Chat**.
4. Tell Hermes what you need, in plain words.

The chat opens in the side bar. You can also move it into its own editor tab.

## What you can do

### Work on your code together

- Ask in plain words. Hermes reads your files, runs commands and changes code for you.
- See what Hermes did: every step in one tidy list, and under each answer the files it
  changed, with a click to see the change.
- Click any file name Hermes mentions to open that file.
- Copy an answer, or ask again with **Retry**.

### Stay in control

- **Hermes asks first.** Before it changes a file or runs a risky command, you see the
  exact change and choose **Deny** or **Allow**. Nothing happens by accident while you
  type.
- **Choose how free Hermes is:** **Manual** (it asks before every change), **Edit
  automatically** (it changes files in this project without asking) or **Auto**. Risky
  commands and sensitive files always ask.
- **Stop at any time**, or type a correction while Hermes works. It reads it at its next
  step.

### Give Hermes the right context

![Picking one of Hermes's skills with "/", and choosing a model with its usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jefuriiij/hermes-studio-releases/main/images/composer.png)

- The file you're in goes along by itself, so Hermes knows what you're looking at.
- Type **@** to add a file from your project.
- Use **+** to add your selection, VS Code's errors, your git changes or a screenshot. You
  can also paste an image.
- Type **/** to use one of Hermes's skills, anywhere in your message. You can use several
  at once.

### Choose your model

- Switch between Claude, ChatGPT, Codex and other models in the middle of a chat. The
  conversation stays.
- See how much of each subscription you've used.
- Hit a usage limit? Continue with another model in one click.
- Choose how hard Hermes thinks, from **Low** to **Max**.

### Pick up where you left off

![How free Hermes is, and how hard it thinks; next to it, the chats of this project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jefuriiij/hermes-studio-releases/main/images/modes.png)

- Every chat is saved, per project. Search them, open one to carry on, rename or delete
  them.
- Start a new chat while Hermes works: the first one keeps going in the background.
- Get a notification when Hermes needs you or is done. On Windows, even when VS Code is
  in the background.

### See what Hermes learns

![What Hermes learned this week, and what it remembers about you and your project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jefuriiij/hermes-studio-releases/main/images/panels.png)

Hermes gets better the more you use it. Hermes Studio shows you how:

- **Learning:** the new skills Hermes made this week and the ones it improved.
- **Memory:** what Hermes remembers about you and your projects.
- **Capabilities:** all its skills and connected tools.
- **Agents:** helpers Hermes started to work on a task in the background.

## Questions

**Does it cost anything?**
No. Hermes Studio and Hermes Agent are free. You only pay for the model subscription you
already use, or nothing with a local model.

**Is my code sent somewhere?**
Hermes Studio itself sends nothing anywhere and collects no data. Your messages go to
Hermes on your computer, and Hermes sends them to the model provider you picked.

**Does it work in other editors?**
Google Antigravity: yes. Download the `.vsix` from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jefuriiij/hermes-studio-releases/releases) and run
**Extensions: Install from VSIX…**. Cursor: no, sorry.

**Does it work on Mac and Linux?**
It is made and tested on Windows. Mac and Linux should work, but have had less testing.
Tell us if something is off.

**Is this made by Nous Research?**
No. Hermes Studio is a community extension by an independent developer. Hermes Agent is
made by Nous Research.

## Something not working?

- **"Hermes not found":** Hermes Agent isn't installed, or it's in a place Hermes Studio
  doesn't look. Install it (see [Before you start](#before-you-start)), or set **Hermes
  Studio: Path** in Settings to the full path of `hermes.exe`.
- **"Setup needed":** Hermes has no model yet. Click **Run setup** and follow the steps.
- **Anything else:** open the Command Palette and run **Hermes Studio: Show Log**, then
  [tell us about it](https://github.com/jefuriiij/hermes-studio-releases/issues) and
  include what the log says.

## Settings

Open Settings and search for **Hermes Studio**:

- **Notifications:** tell you when Hermes needs you, is done or stopped. On by default.
- **Windows Notifications:** also show them in Windows while VS Code is in the
  background. On by default.
- **Path:** where Hermes is, if Hermes Studio can't find it by itself.
